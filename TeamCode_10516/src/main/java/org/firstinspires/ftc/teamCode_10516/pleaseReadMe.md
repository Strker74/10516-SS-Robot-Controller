# FTC Team 10516 High Ground Team Code

Welcome!

As mentioned in our engineering notebook, our programming team uses GitHub to effectively communicate with each other concerning programs. Our programming structure was also quite different in comparison to many other teams' code. As an overview, this directory holds 4 contents: this file (pleaseReadMe.md), the folder for autonomous programs (Autonomous), the folder for driver-controlled programs (TeleOp), and our Robot class (Robot.java). Below, each content is expanded on:

## Robot.java

Robot.java was our primary class where we stored the hardare for our robot. Along with this, we also had our methods, for both autonomous and teleOperator. In every other OpMode, we imported this class and created a new instance of the motor.
